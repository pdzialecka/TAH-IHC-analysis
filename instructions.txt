IHC analysis instructions

Required sofware
* Matlab + Image Processing Toolbox, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
* Fiji

Setup instructions
1) FIJI-Matlab communication
a) Install Fiji if you don't have it already, e.g. on Desktop ('C:\Users\Pat\Desktop\Fiji.app')
b) Copy mij.jar file from Libraries folder into your Matlab java folder, e.g. 'C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2021a\java\jar\mij.jar'
c) In utils/setup_miji(): change directory folders to match your configuration. This ensures Matlab can use java to control Fiji
   e.g. Matlab folder from step b: 'C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2021a\java\jar\mij.jar'
   Fiji installation from step a: 'C:\Users\Pat\Desktop\Fiji.app\jars\ij-1.53q.jar';'C:\Users\Pat\Desktop\Fiji.app\scripts'

2) Directory
* In IHC_simple: change directory of analysis_folder variable to match location of the analysis folder on your computer
  e.g. analysis_folder = 'C:\Users\Pat\OneDrive - Imperial College London\AD_TI_hipp\Analysis\IHC';

3) Test whether the scripts work by running IHC_simple.m file after completing the setup steps. Example image has been provided inside Images folder


Analysis steps
1) Deconvolution of H and DAB channels, done on the full image (Fiji) -> FUNCTION: deconvolve_full
2) Selection of ROIs for each image (right hipp, left hipp, right cortex, left cortex, control area) -> FUNCTION: select_roi
3) Quantification of % area covered by antibody -> FUNCTION: analyse_data


To define the threshold the antibody labelling has to pass to be counted, go to utils/get_antibody_threshold and adjust the values


FILE & FOLDER NAMES ARE IMPORTANT!

Folder structure
* Data is stored under 'xxx\IHC\Images\Mouse_name'
* Deconvolved images are saved inside 'xxx\IHC\Images\Mouse_name\Processed'
* Selected ROIs are saved inside 'xxx\IHC\ROIs\Mouse_name'
* Results are saved inside 'xxx\IHC\Results\Mouse_name'

Expected file names: mouse_name-antibody_name, e.g. AD-Hipp28_moc23.svs
